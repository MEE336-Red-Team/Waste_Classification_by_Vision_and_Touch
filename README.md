# Waste Classification by Vision and Touch
> Final Project

---

## Target
We will review the literature and use vision-based or optical fiber-based tactile sensing method and omni-directional interactive soft finger to build up a two-finger-parallel gripper on the UR10 robot.

## Submission Material

## Project Proposal
> Due Sunday, Mar 14

Describe:

* What is the problem that we will be investigating? Why is it interesting?
* What reading will you examine to provide context and background?
* What data will you use? If you are collecting new data, how will you do it?
* What method or algorithm are we proposing? If there are existing implementations, will we use them and how? How do we plan to improve or modify such implementations?
* How will we evaluate the results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do we expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quatitatively, what kind of analysis will we use to evaluate and/or compare the results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?

## Project Milestone
> Due Sunday, Apr 18

Suggested structure:

* **Title, Author(s)**
* **Introduction**: this section introduces your problem, and the overall plan for approaching your problem
* **Problem statement**: describe the problem precisely specifying the dataset to be used, expected results and evaluation
* **Technical Approach**: describe the methods you intend to apply to solve the given problem
* **Intermediate/Preliminary Results**: state and evaluate your results upto the milestone

## Final Report
> Due Wednesday, May 26

The final write-up is required to be between 6-8 pages using the provided template, structured like a paper from a robot learning conference (CoRL, ICRA, IROS, etc.).

Source code, cool videos, interactive visualizations, demos, etc.
